# MNIST-Deep-Neural-Network-Numpy
Training MNIST Dataset Deep Neural Network using NumPy only, MNIST consists of 70,000 grayscale images. Training Images are 60,000 Testing Images are 10,000. Neural Network Architecture: Input layer of 784 neurons (representing the 28x28 pixel images), one or more hidden layers, and an output layer of 10 neurons (one for each digit).
